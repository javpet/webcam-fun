Using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() to use webcam functionality and take pictures, based on [Wes Bos' tutorial #20](http://wesbos.com)

I have enjoyed this tutorial the most so far from the Javascript30 course. Using the canvas + webcam we can take pictures of us and save it into a photostream.

Have a big smile ðŸ˜‚, collect your friends ðŸ™Œ, have an instand photobooth [try it out here](https://javpet.github.io/webcam-fun/). You can also download the made images from the photostrip.
